# Momenter

Momenter is designed to trigger events at specific moments in time. Its core purpose is to execute predefined actions at precise time intervals (moments), allowing for fine control over the timing of events. Whether youâ€™re building a timer, scheduler, or need to execute tasks based on specific durations, Momenter helps you manage those moments efficiently.

## Basic Example
```dart
final momenter = Momenter<Moment>();

// Add moments (specific times to trigger events)
momenter.add(Moment(Duration(seconds: 1)));
momenter.add(Moment(Duration(seconds: 2)));

// Add a listener to track when moments are triggered and other state changes
momenter.addListener((event) {
  switch (event) {
    case MomenterPlay():
      print('Momenter started playing');
    case MomenterPause():
      print('Momenter paused');
    case MomenterTriggered<Moment>(:final moment):
      print('Moment triggered: ${moment.value}');
    case MomenterCompleted():
      print('All moments completed');
  }
});

momenter.play();
```
